## What is it?
<p>This project is a Weather app made in Kivy(multiplatform, naturaly resizable framework for Python).</p>
<p>Video of this project: https://youtu.be/Hvwrgvm8alE </p>
<p>I only just now realised that the recorder doesnt show my mouse, so during those akwardly long pauses I was circling around what changed, hopefully it doesnt matter too much.</p>

## Why did I do it?
<p>I did this specific project to learn how APIs work in Python and to further my knowledge about the Kivy framework, for example I learned new things about the Kivy canvas.</p>

## Features
<p>Main screen with all necessary info and a dynamicaly changing background based on the weather of the selected city (It even changes based on if its day or night in the selected city).</p>
<p>User can make a list of cities and then simply select which one will be displayed.</p>
<p>User can add cities by their name in the add city popup.</p>
<p>Saving the cities, api keys and a history of searched cities in json files.</p>
<p>A scroll view with all the cities listed.</p>
<p>Option to delete a city from the list or delete all cities from the list.</p>
<p>The weather updates itself automatically every 2 minutes.</p>
